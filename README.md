### Description

Want to move objects in a smooth curves. A catmull-rom Path moving algorithm is presented here.

This very simple program show you how to:

1) Create smooth path interpolations with the Catmull-rom algorithm (Curve passes smoothly through the control points you provide).

2) Move objects through the path generated.

Forward referencing is used to solve the Catmull-rom cubical equation, where adding the third dimension is just that easy as a Copy-Paste operation.
